# @urban-ui/styles

Specific shared styles for components.

These are only useful when components are semantically different things but share complex styles to appear visually the same.

This should only be considered a viable option when styling is complex, generally in-situ styling should be preferred and stylex will handle the deduplication of styles.

Cases where semantically different but visually similar components are extremely rare.
