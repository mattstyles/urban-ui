# @urban-ui/center

Helper layout component for centering children.

## Installation

```bash
bun add @urban-ui/center
```

## Usage

```tsx
import { Center } from '@urban-ui/center'

<Center>
  <div>Centered content</div>
</Center>
```

The Center component uses Flex internally with `align="center"` and `justify="center"` to center its children both horizontally and vertically.
