## Colour

Text colour is defined by `anatomy.color` and will fallback to the global `fg.hi` variable.

This means that if a tonality is set higher up the tree then text will use the tonal variant for foreground colour by default.

Any tonal variant (or using the global colours) can be manually applied to the text component.
