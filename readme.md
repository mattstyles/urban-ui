# Urban-ui

> A design system built with accessibility at its core.

Key tenets:

- Accessibility
- Semantic meaning
- Anatomy based customisation

> React Server Component friendly

Key parts of the system:

- Headful components
- A robust styling system using css variables
- Semi-strict bounded sets of properties

Built on top of [React-Aria](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/index.html), Urban-ui is a headful design system that exposes customisation of components via css variables. Each component defines its anatomy in terms of variables and provides defaults to a structured theming specification built atop [styled-system](https://styled-system.com/theme-specification/).
